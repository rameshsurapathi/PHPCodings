The Idea of PicsCave.com came from the below story.

One day,one of my friends facebook account got hacked.She called to me and told about her account got hacked.
After that,she immediately reported to facebook.But Facebook told,we cant help you,because we cannot identify,whose 
photos are real and whose photos are fake.Facebook asked my friend to mail a copy of her passport and other identification details.
She mailed all her identification details,but still Facebook failed to help her.

That day,I thought, Facebook ,the world's largest social network is not able to protect their users photos.
And the the question is 'Why they are not able to identify the real photos from fake photos?'.

So,how PicsCave.com can help in it.
